This is "Build a Javascript Calculator" Project from FreeCodeCamp's "Advanced Front End Development Projects"

I used a html/css Calculator Mockup from Codepen.io because it looks nicer than anything I would come up with.  I also included math.js so my calculator could evaluate numbers with decimals.

The "Live" version of the app is avaiable on Github Pages - https://josephcode773.github.io/fccCalculator/
